      <description>One of the more challenging tasks in the past few months was for me was to find a way to implement the following feature:
After a set amount of seconds (provided in the form of an environment variable) launch a goroutine which sends control data to another service with a way to cancel the whole process in case of an external event. If you come from perhaps a Java background then this task seems pretty trivial, you &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; have to call the interrupt() function on your thread, but with goroutines this is not an option.</description>

      <description>While working on a project I received a bug report that there is a 1 hour difference between dates at one part of my service and after an hour of trying to reproduce to issue, we came to the conclusion that the reason why it was so hard to track down was that our GKE cluster operates in the UTC timezone, while my local environment (and even our production cluster) is in the Europe/Budapest timezone.</description>
